 The map displayed above depicts how the people in different states feel about Texas. This image is generated by:
 
 + Collecting public Twitter posts (tweets) that have been tagged with geographic locations and filtering for those that contain the "texas" query term,
+ Assigning a sentiment (positive or negative) to each tweet, based on all of the words it contains,
+ Aggregating tweets by the state with the closest geographic center, and finally
+ Coloring each state according to the aggregate sentiment of its tweets. Red means positive sentiment; blue means negative.
